 Title:
    Problem Resolution.
Description:
    This document outlines the processes and procedures for effectively identifying, analyzing, and resolving errors.
Purpose:
     The purpose of this document is to provide a structured approach to error resolution to minimize downtime, enhance productivity, and ensure consistent quality in products/services.
Identify the Issue:
     Clearly define the problem.Gather relevant information, including symptoms, context, and impact. Assess the Impact
Issue: Software Application Crashes on Startup
   Step 1: Identify the Issue
        Description: Users report that the software application crashes immediately upon startup.
        Impact: This affects all users, halting productivity.
   Step 2: Assess the Impact
        Severity: Critical
        Affected Users: All users of the application.
   Step 3: Analyze the Root Cause
        Gather Data:
          Check error logs for crash reports.
          Collect user reports detailing system specifications and circumstances under which the crash occurs.
        Root Cause Analysis:
           Use 5 Whys:
               Why does the application crash? → It encounters an unhandled exception.
               Why is there an unhandled exception? → There is a missing dependency.
               Why is there a missing dependency? → The installation package did not include it.
               Documentation: Record findings in a shared document.
  Step 4: Develop Solutions
        Proposed Solutions:
           Update the installation package to include the missing dependency.
           Create an error handling mechanism to manage exceptions more gracefully.
           Evaluate Solutions:
                Prioritize updating the installation package as it is the quickest fix.
 Step 5: Implement the Solution
       Action Plan:
          Update the installation package.
          Test the new package internally before release.
          Assign Responsibilities:
          Developer A to update the package.
           QA team to test the new version.
 Step 6: Test and Verify
     Testing:
        Conduct tests with various user environments to ensure the application starts without crashing.
        Confirm that the missing dependency is now included.
        Document Results: Note that the issue is resolved in the testing documentation.
  Step 7: Review and Prevent
         Review Process:
            Hold a meeting with the team to discuss what went wrong and how to improve the deployment process.
            Preventive Measures:
            Implement a checklist for installation package reviews to ensure all dependencies are included.
            Set up regular training for developers on best practices for dependency management.
  Step 8: Document the Process
          Final Documentation:
          Create a summary report detailing the issue, analysis, solutions implemented, testing results, and preventive measures for 
          future reference.
